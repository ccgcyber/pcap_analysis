The idea of dividing the session in the project:
1. in HTTP_list to find the first request HTML http request (get init_req)
2. can be init_req client-> server sockets and http_list in the pos
3. in the msg_list init_req pos back to find, server-> client direction sockets the first response (ie init_req response) (get init_response)
4. in the init_response page to extract all the links (links_set)
5. in the msg_list's pos swept all over again req, in the links_set will write down its sockets (get sockets_set)
6. all packets in sockets_set belong to a session



To determine whether a http request in the link_set, only need to see whether the request uri link_set is any link in the "substring"
Because uri are generally relative path, and link_set may be relative path, there may be an absolute path, anyway, is greater than uri "big, so see if uri link_set is the link string
