Problem:
    A_dict = {}
    A_list = []
    For ...
        Modify a_dict content
        A_list.append (a_dict)

    Finally found that a_list inside the same is a dict! The The
Solution:
    The solution is very simple, change the following line:
    A_list = []
    For ...
        A_dict = {}
        Modify a_dict content
        A_list.append (a_dict)

    Shallow reason: because append time, not a new object into a new insert, which led to each insert are the same object, the last list of all loaded with the same dict, so the content is exactly the same (All the last modified content)
    Deep reason: must be a profound understanding of this problem, which is very different with a mechanism of c
              1: In python, everything is the object, even the right value is an object (rather than a simple constant string)
              2: parameter transfer, the assignment process is certainly used to "pass the object reference"
              3: When the object reference number is 0, the object will be automatically destroyed (each reference once, reference count +1; each del or variable reference to another object once, reference count -1)
              Please understand the following example:
              A = 'abcd'
              B = a
              A = 'efg'
              Print a
              Print b
              The output is: efg abcd
              This is because 1: a references the 'abcd' object
                     2: b = a, so b also refers to the 'abcd' object
                     3: a = 'efg', resulting in a as a reference to 'efg', and b is a 'abcd' reference

Problem:
    The contents of the document is a fixed format, such as the c in a struct written to a document (such as the order of 2 bytes, 2 bytes, 4 bytes), how to read the contents of the contents of the python Variable to go
Solution:
    Practice: read the file into a string, then a = string [0: 2], b = string [2: 4] so
    Simple approach: the use of struct unpack function

    If you want to return multiple values ​​in python, use tuple will be very simple and convenient

Problem:
    Parsed out of the tcp header, printed out of seq_num and ack_num with wireshark inconsistent
Solution:
    This is because the two wires are used in these two values ​​are relative value, rather than absolute value
    The relative value means: all SEQ and ACK numbers always start at 0 for the first packet seen in each conversation.

Tips:
    Python if you print the contents of an object, directly print my_obj .__ dict__ on the line, very simple, do not write what print_info function. The The The

Problem:
    Many browsers will cache the page, if the request to join "If Modified Since", so that the server returns a http 304 (the server will not have to return to the page content)
    The browser will be able to use the contents of the cache, which is a big problem for this project (because I was based on the first request as a basis for the separation of the session)
Solution:
    This is not solution! Browser ctr + f5 can not cache
    This is only used to test this project can not be used for the normal cache, the cache is really powerless

Tips:
    When the page is captured, if the server returns the result is gzip-encode then content inside is compressed by the content, and wireshark will automatically decompress it,
    Get the contents of the decompression (need to verify that the content is not in the pcap file, or that this function is the wirehark client to read the pcap file to do a deal)
    In addition Winshark also provides a reassemble segment function, need to verify whether the contents of this reorganization of the pcap file, if not, need to do their own trouble
    These features are wireshark pcap packet analysis shows the additional information, pcap file which is not these things (the original pcap file is captured to the bottom of the data
    How could there be such a very top function to achieve the content? )

Tips:
    In a tcp connection, the request and the response is always a one-to-one correspondence, that is, in a tcp connection, a request followed by the event will always be its response, but not other responses or other requests

Problem:
    Gzip extract the contents of http can not extract
Solution:
    In the http message, the header is "\ r \ n" do wrap, and finally will be more of a line, with particular attention to the line is the content of the content, but not the header, the line To the contents of the decompression on the success of the

    Matplotlib, to draw 15 pillars, only one has a height, the rest are 0, then only a high degree of this show, the other is not, even the abscissa are not
